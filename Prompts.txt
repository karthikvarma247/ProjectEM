data_management_prompt = '''1** designed to extract the necessary information for determining the **MDM Data Management Level** from a medical record, based on AMA guidelines. This prompt focuses on identifying key elements in the categories of **Lab Orders, Test Reviews, Independent Interpretations, External Data, and Independent Historian**:

---

### **Prompt 1: Information Extraction for MDM Data Management**
**Role**: You are a medical coding expert analyzing a patient's medical record to extract specific details for MDM level calculation under AMA guidelines.  
**Task**: Identify and list ONLY the following elements from the medical record:  

#### **1. Lab Orders Placed**  
- **Definition**: Tests ordered during the encounter (e.g., blood tests, imaging).  
- **Extract**: List each **unique test ordered** (e.g., "CBC," "Lipid Panel," "CT Chest").  
- **Note**: Ignore duplicates (e.g., 2x CBC = 1 unique test).  

#### **2. Results Reviewed**  
- **Definition**: Results of tests **reviewed** during the encounter (e.g., lab results, precision tests, imaging reports).  
- **Extract**: List each **unique test reviewed** (e.g., "Genetic Test BRCA1," "COVID-19 PCR Result").  

#### **3. Independent Interpretations**  
- **Definition**: Tests where the provider **personally analyzed raw data** (e.g., EKG tracings, biopsy slides) instead of relying solely on another clinician's report.  
- **Extract**: List tests with **explicit documentation** of independent interpretation (e.g., "I reviewed the MRI images myself").  

#### **4. External Data Reviewed**  
- **Definition**: Data obtained from **external sources** (e.g., records from another hospital, specialist consult notes).  
- **Extract**: List each **unique external source** (e.g., "Dr. Smith's Cardiology Report," "ABC Lab Records").  

#### **5. Independent Historian**  
- **Definition**: History obtained from a **non-family/caregiver source** (e.g., paramedic, social worker) due to patient incapacity.  
- **Extract**: State `true` if present (with role, e.g., "EMT history"), else `false`.

### **Output Format Requirements**  
Return a **strict JSON object** with these keys:  
```json
{
  "lab_orders_placed": ["test1", "test2", ...],
  "results_reviewed": ["test1", "test2", ...],
  "independent_interpretations": ["test1", "test2", ...],
  "external_data_reviewed": ["source1", "source2", ...],
  "independent_historian": "true/false with role (if true)"
}
```  

### **Medical Record Input**  
```  
[Insert patient's medical record text here]  
```  

---

### **Example**  
**Medical Record Snippet**:  
> "Ordered CBC and liver enzymes. Reviewed prior genetic test (OncoType DX) and chest X-ray from City Hospital. Interpreted EKG strips directly. History obtained from EMS due to patient confusion."  

**Output**:  
```json
{
  "lab_orders_placed": ["CBC", "Liver Enzymes"],
  "results_reviewed": ["OncoType DX", "Chest X-ray"],
  "independent_interpretations": ["EKG Strips"],
  "external_data_reviewed": ["City Hospital Records"],
  "independent_historian": "true (EMS)"
}
```

---

### **Key Instructions**  
- **Be specific**: Use exact test/source names from the record.  
- **Exclude non-relevant data**: Ignore HPI, Assessment/Plan, or non-test-related notes.  
- **No scoring/analysis**: Only extract facts. Scoring happens in Prompt 2.  

After running this prompt, feed the JSON output into **Prompt 2** (which contains AMA scoring rules) to determine the final MDM level for Data Management.

# AMA MDM COMPLEXITY DETERMINATION TABLE - IMPROVED PROMPT

## CRITICAL EVALUATION RULES
1. **STRICT CATEGORY REQUIREMENTS**: Each category has minimum thresholds that MUST be met exactly
2. **NO PARTIAL CREDIT**: If minimum requirements aren't met, that category CANNOT be counted
3. **HIERARCHICAL CLASSIFICATION**: Evaluate ALL levels, report ALL that qualify (High > Moderate > Low > Straightforward)
4. **EXPLICIT DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED**: Only count what is explicitly documented, not implied

---

## COMPLEXITY LEVELS & REQUIREMENTS

### STEP 1: HIGH COMPLEXITY (Extensive)
**Requires ≥2 categories from the following 3:**

**Category 1: Tests, Documents, or Independent Historian(s)**
- **MINIMUM REQUIREMENT**: Must have ANY combination of **EXACTLY 3 OR MORE** from:
  - Review of prior external note(s) from each unique source
  - Review of the result(s) of each unique test
  - Ordering of each unique test
  - Assessment requiring an independent historian(s)
- **⚠️ CRITICAL**: If fewer than 3 items are met, DO NOT count Category 1 at all

**Category 2: Independent Interpretation**
- Independent interpretation of tests performed by another physician/qualified healthcare professional (not separately reported)

**Category 3: External Discussion**
- Discussion of management or test interpretation with external physician/qualified healthcare professional/appropriate source (not separately reported)

---

### STEP 2: MODERATE COMPLEXITY
**Requires ≥1 category from the following 3:**

**Category 1: Tests, Documents, or Independent Historian(s)**
- **MINIMUM REQUIREMENT**: Must have ANY combination of **EXACTLY 3 OR MORE** from:
  - Review of prior external note(s) from each unique source
  - Review of the result(s) of each unique test
  - Ordering of each unique test
  - Assessment requiring an independent historian(s)
- **⚠️ CRITICAL**: If fewer than 3 items are met, DO NOT count Category 1 at all

**Category 2: Independent Interpretation**
- Independent interpretation of tests performed by another physician/qualified healthcare professional (not separately reported)

**Category 3: External Discussion**
- Discussion of management or test interpretation with external physician/qualified healthcare professional/appropriate source (not separately reported)

---

### STEP 3: LOW COMPLEXITY
**Requires ≥1 category from the following 2:**

**Category 1: Tests and Documents**
- **MINIMUM REQUIREMENT**: Must have ANY combination of **EXACTLY 2 OR MORE** from:
  - Review of prior external note(s) from each unique source
  - Review of the result(s) of each unique test
  - Ordering of each unique test
- **⚠️ CRITICAL**: If fewer than 2 items are met, DO NOT count Category 1 at all

**Category 2: Independent Historian**
- Assessment requiring an independent historian(s)

---

### STEP 4: STRAIGHTFORWARD COMPLEXITY
**Requires ANY ONE of the following:**
- Review of prior external note(s) from each unique source
- Review of the result(s) of each unique test
- Ordering of each unique test
- **OR** No data review/analysis documented

---

## EVALUATION PROTOCOL

### Phase 1: Count Elements
For each complexity level, systematically count:
1. **External notes reviewed** (count unique sources only)
2. **Test results reviewed** (count unique tests only)
3. **Tests ordered** (count unique tests only)
4. **Independent historian assessments**
5. **Independent interpretations**
6. **External discussions**

### Phase 2: Apply Category Rules
For each level, check if categories meet minimum thresholds:
- **High/Moderate Category 1**: Needs ≥3 elements
- **Low Category 1**: Needs ≥2 elements
- **Straightforward**: Needs ≥1 element

### Phase 3: Determine Qualifying Levels
- Count qualifying categories for each level
- Apply minimum category requirements:
  - **High**: ≥2 categories
  - **Moderate**: ≥1 category
  - **Low**: ≥1 category
  - **Straightforward**: Any single element OR no documentation

### Phase 4: Report All Qualifying Levels
List ALL levels that meet requirements, with highest level first.

---

## VALIDATION CHECKLIST
- [ ] Distinct sources verified (no duplicates counted)
- [ ] Minimum thresholds strictly enforced
- [ ] Only explicitly documented items counted
- [ ] All qualifying levels identified
- [ ] Proper justification provided for each level

---

## EDGE CASE PROTOCOLS

### Duplicate Handling
- Same test multiple times → Count as 1 unique test
- Same external source multiple times → Count as 1 unique source

### Documentation Requirements
- "Reviewed outside records" → Requires specific source identification
- "Lab results reviewed" → Must specify which tests
- Implied review without explicit statement → Do not count

---

## REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Output MUST use EXACTLY this JSON format without any modifications:

```json
"Data Review Complexity": [
  {
    "id": "data-high-1",
    "checked": true,
    "AMA_reference": "High Complexity - Category 1 & Category 2 met",
    "justification": "Patient presents with acute decompensated heart failure with EF decreased from 40% to 25% indicating severe exacerbation, requiring immediate intervention with IV diuretics. Met Category 1 (3+ elements: reviewed 2 external notes, 1 test result, ordered 1 test) and Category 2 (independent EKG interpretation).",
    "reference": {
      "source": "Assessment & Plan",
      "text": "Patient presents with worsening heart failure symptoms, EF decreased from 40% to 25%"
    }
  },
  {
    "id": "data-moderate-1", 
    "checked": true,
    "AMA_reference": "Moderate Complexity - Category 1 met",
    "justification": "Same case qualifies for Moderate (requires ≥1 category): Category 1 met with 4 elements (2 external notes reviewed, 1 test result reviewed, 1 test ordered).",
    "reference": {
      "source": "Historical Diagnoses", 
      "text": "CKD stage 4 noted with stable creatinine trends, Cr increased from 2.1 to 3.8 mg/dL over the past year."
    }
  },
  {
    "id": "data-low-1",
    "checked": false,
    "AMA_reference": "Low Complexity - Not applicable", 
    "justification": "Higher complexity levels already met.",
    "reference": {
      "source": "",
      "text": ""
    }
  },
  {
    "id": "data-straightforward-1",
    "checked": false,
    "AMA_reference": "Straightforward - Not applicable",
    "justification": "Higher complexity levels already met.", 
    "reference": {
      "source": "",
      "text": ""
    }
  }
]
```

## OUTPUT GENERATION RULES

1. **Always include all 4 complexity levels** in the array (High, Moderate, Low, Straightforward)
2. **Set "checked": true** for ALL levels that meet requirements 
3. **Set "checked": false** for levels that don't qualify
4. **Use sequential IDs**: data-high-1, data-moderate-1, data-low-1, data-straightforward-1
5. **AMA_reference field**: Briefly state which categories were met or why not applicable
6. **Justification field**: Provide detailed explanation with specific element counts
7. **Reference fields**: Use actual documentation source and relevant text excerpt

## CRITICAL REMINDERS
1. **NO PARTIAL CREDIT**: 2 out of 3 required elements = Category 1 DOES NOT QUALIFY
2. **COUNT ALL LEVELS**: A case can qualify for multiple levels simultaneously
3. **EXPLICIT DOCUMENTATION ONLY**: "Patient had prior workup" ≠ "Reviewed external cardiology note from Dr. Smith dated 1/15/24"
4. **UNIQUE SOURCES/TESTS ONLY**: Multiple CBCs = 1 test type

## **Critical Instructions**
1. **Count each unique item only once** - multiple CBCs = 1 count
2. **Provide specific details** for each item to support MDM evaluation
3. **Include category analysis** to help with threshold determination
4. **Be explicit about external sources** - distinguish from internal records
5. **Only count what is explicitly documented** - no assumptions or implications
